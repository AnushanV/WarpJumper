## Description

Warp jumper is a 2D platformer game developed in Unity. In this game, players must navigate through four levels while avoiding obstacles, fighting enemies, and performing platforming challenges. The player controls a character who can move, attack with a sword, shoot arrows, and throw a magic sword which they can warp to.

The magic sword acts as a unique movement mechanic. Players can throw this sword in 8 directions. After the sword is thrown, players can warp to the sword. This allows players to move quickly, and also make it to platforms that are farther away.
